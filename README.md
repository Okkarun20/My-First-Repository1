### Genre 
Romance Comedy
#### Why I Like this Anime:
I like the plot of the anime. It is fun to watch because of the quirky characters. They think of a plan to confess, and whoever confesses first loses. It is enjoyable to watch, and I laughed in the scene where they demonstrated their tactics and failed. I like the last episode of the anime, in which both parties confess their love at the clock tower. Sometimes, I rewatch the whole anime; it never gets me bored.
