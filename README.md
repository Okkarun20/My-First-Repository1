### Genre

#### Why I Like this anime:
I like the plot of the anime. It is fun to watch because of the quirky characters, They think of a plan to confess and whoever confesses first loses. It very fun to watch and I ended up laughing in the scene that they demonstrate their tactics and fail. I like the last episode of the anime which both parties are confess their love at the clock tower. Sometimes i am rewatching the whole anime it never gets me bored.
